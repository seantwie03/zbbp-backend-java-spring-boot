## Reference Project

This is a reference project. It has proven useful in situations where I spend several months working on a frontend
project, then need to return to backend work. In those situations, this repository is a useful reminder of some
techniques used in Java and Spring Boot applications.

Being a reference project, you'll notice it is over-engineered, over-commented, and over-tested. The purpose is not to
demonstrate the 'best' way to build a Spring Boot application. Instead, the purpose is to show several techniques for
accomplishing different programming tasks using Java and Spring Boot.

You may also notice that similar tasks may be accomplished in different ways from one file to the next. For example, I
may test one controller using JsonPath and another using string comparison. Normally this inconsistency would be
something to avoid, but it is encouraged in a reference project because the main point of this project is to demonstrate
many useful techniques.
