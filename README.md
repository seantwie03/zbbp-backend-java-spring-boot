## Items to Consider

### Should I specify the DateTimeFormat in the Response objects?

Right now I am using whatever the default option for Spring Boot is. It seems to be working for so far, but I do have to
add additional configuration like below when using ObjectMapper in Controller Integration Tests.

```
  private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper()
        // With the JavaTimeModule registered to handle the budgetDate
        .registerModule(new JavaTimeModule()).configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS,false);
```

Perhaps if I were to specify a specific DateTimeFormat then I wouldn't need this additional configuration.

## Decisions

### Should records in the dto layer have builders?

All other records and data classes have builders, it feels strange for the DTO layer to be different. That being said,
the builders will likely only be used in test code or in code generated by MapStruct.

If I do add builders I should revisit the use of constructors in the Controller Integration Tests.

**Decision**
Reading *Refactoring* by Martin Fowler, it mentions the 'Speculative Generality' code smell. It specifically says
"Speculative generality can be spotted when the only users of a function or class are test cases." I want to avoid
this code smell, so I will not add builders to the DTO layer until it is needed by production code.
